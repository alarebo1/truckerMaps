## Purpose

TruckerMaps is a logistics tool meant to help truckers by giving them an organized view of warehouses they need to reach and the time they need to be there by.
It uses the Google Places API to ensure that the truckers are receiving quick and consistent location data and getting them to the correct location on time.
It uses the Google Maps API to give the truckers an interactive map widget which they can use to view their target locations and nearby routes.

## User Experience

Insert user stories, ideal usage, and UI navigation.

- Users will be met with a login screen where they can either sign into their account or create a new one.
- Next they will be greeted with the main dashboard navigation system.
  - View deliveries, add locations, view/edit profile
- Delivery page: lists all current deliveries and their status 'on-time / late'
- Add Location: form for user to search an address and add it to their saved locations
